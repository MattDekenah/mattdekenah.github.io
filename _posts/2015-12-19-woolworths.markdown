description: Woolworths has unfortunately decided to dicontinue their wedding registry service as of the 31st December 2015.  Great pity, we know.  Of course shopping online is still easy and there is a Woolworths store on every corner too, so if you'd like to buy something from them you shouldn't run into too much trouble.  We can't avoid duplicates, but Woolworths does have a great exchange policy, so don't trouble yourself on that account.
